# CatScratch
BoilerMake hackathon project

## Inspiration 
We wanted to combine our love for space cats with the harassment challenge!

## What It Does 
It is a web app that replaces all words in a Twitter feed based on a given key word by the user that qualifies as harassment with the phrase **SPACE CAT**.

## How We Built It 
Python, Twitter API, JavaScript, Node.js, and a handful of frameworks.

## Challenges 
The team overall did not have much experience with web apps, so making everything work together took some time.

## What's Next for CatScratch? 
Cat emojis! :cat:
